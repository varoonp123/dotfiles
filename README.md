My setup is mainly my i3wm setup, (neo)vim configs, and a collections of things to apt install to make my local env less
terrible as quickly as possible.

## Unautomated
- Docker desktop for linux is a tad in flux. For now, after bootstrapping, which does some [docker
  operations](./bootscripts/src/docker.sh), [do whatever the Docker docs
  say](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/). As of 2023, this involves downloading a file from the Docker
  website. Maybe apt install it later? Idk what the most reliable boostrapable way of install docker alongside my dev
  env is.
- I installed VSCode, Chrome, and (maybe a few others?) manually since I want a relatively recent version. Maybe try
  [flatpack next time?](https://flathub.org/apps/com.visualstudio.code)?
